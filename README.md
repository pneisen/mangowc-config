# mangowc-config

[MangoWC](https://github.com/DreamMaoMao/mangowc) is a fork of DWL which is a wayland version of the suckless DWM. I ran DWM for a very long time and now I am returning to something like it. This is a place to capture my config files. Some of this stolen from [tony](https://github.com/tonybanters/mangowc-btw).
